## Phase 2 Code Challenge: Bot Battlr
## Overview
Bot Battlr is an interactive React application designed to help users (galactic overlords) build and manage their own bot army. Users can browse a catalog of bots, enlist them into their army, release enlisted bots, and permanently delete bots from both the frontend and backend. This project was developed as part of Moringa Schoolâ€™s Phase 2 React Code Challenge, focusing on core React concepts including functional components, hooks (state/effects), props, and data fetching from a local JSON API.

## Features âœ¨
## Bot Battlr delivers these key functionalities:

View All Bots: Fetch and display a dynamic collection of available bots from a local JSON database.
Enlist Bots: Add bots to your personal army with duplicate preventionâ€”bots remain visible in the main collection.
Release Bots: Remove bots from your army without altering the main collection.
Delete Bots: Permanently remove a bot from the backend database (DELETE /bots/:id) and the frontend army.
Responsive Card Layout: Bots are rendered in a grid of cards, automatically adjusting to screen size.
Clean UI: Organized interface with clear visual hierarchy, hover effects, and action buttons for intuitive interactions.
Tech Stack 
React.js: Core frontend framework (JSX, functional components, hooks).
JSON Server: Mock backend API for storing and fetching bot data.
HTML/CSS: Component-based styling for responsive layouts.
JavaScript (ES6+): For state management, API interactions, and event handling.


## Project Structure 
The project follows a modular React structure for maintainability:



Phase-2-Code-Challenge-Bot-Battlr/  # Root project folder (matches your terminal path)
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                         # Static assets (HTML, favicons)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html                  # Entry point for React rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                            # Application source code

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BotCollection.jsx       # Renders grid of available bots (uses BotCard)

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx                     # Main component: orchestrates state (bots/army) and fetches data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.jsx                   # React app entry: mounts root component to DOM

â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ App.css                 # Global app styling
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ BotCard.css             # Styling for BotCard component
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ BotArmyCard.css         # Styling for BotArmyCard component

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.css               # Base styles (optional, if used)
â”œâ”€â”€ db.json                         # Backend database (stores bot data)
â””â”€â”€ package.json                    # Dependencies, scripts, and project metadata

Installation & Setup ðŸš€
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended) with npm.
Git (for cloning the repository).
Steps
Clone the Repository

git clone <git@github.com:Ahman04/phase-2-code-challenge-bot-battlr.git>  
cd Phase-2-Code-Challenge-Bot-Battlr  # Navigate to project root  
Install Dependencies
Fetch React, JSON Server, and other required packages:
bash


npm install  
Start Development Servers
Run both the React app and JSON server concurrently using the dev script (defined in package.json):
bash


Future Improvements 
To enhance Bot Battlr further, consider these additions:

Search/Filter: Allow users to filter bots by class (Support, Medic, etc.) or search by name.
Sorting: Add a SortBar component to sort bots by health, damage, or armor.
Animations: Implement smooth transitions when enlisting/releasing bots (e.g., fade-in/out).
Persistent Storage: Use localStorage or a backend database to retain army data between sessions.
Catchphrase Truncation: Shorten long catchphrases with a "Read More" toggle for cleaner UI.
